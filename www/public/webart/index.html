                A web study is small internet based application that
                demonstrates only a small artistic or technical concept.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ones you find here are built with various tools, some make
                up the framework and others are used to implement the concept
                being studied.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the framework, preact is used to manage state and render a
                self made library of reusable components. Webpack is used to
                compile this code into browser preferred javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
                To implement the studies' core concepts, either d3.js or a
                custom web-assembly module is used.
