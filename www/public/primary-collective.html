          <h1>Primary Collective</h1>
          <h3>A Collective of Creatives</h3>
          <p>It is with great pleasure to introduce Primary Collective. Stemming from a partnership of great minds, PDW aims to be a cutting edge source of digital creations. The intention of PDW as a collective is to use creativity and skills to add value to the world and spread it amongst all its inhabitants.</p><h3>Primes</h3><p>Over 2000 years ago, Euclid had proved that there were infinitely many prime numbers. Primes are unique and diverse. They are the building blocks of all numbers. At the core of all creativity, a prime number can be found somewhere.</p>
          <p>For these reasons, members of the PDW collective will be considered "primes". The one unifying trait of all primes is a focus on Art, Science, and Innovation.</p>
          <p>We are releasing our first NFT collection on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cartesian-bloom" target="_blank">OpenSea</a>.</p>
          <h3>Cartesian Bloom Collection</h3><p>"We do not describe the world we see, we see the world we can describe." - Rene Descartes</p>
          <p>Math is fundamental. The Pythagorean Cult of Ancient Greece felt a strong resonation in ratios and natural numbers. They saw how these ratios could be used to solve problems in the real world. Through this type of thought, they developed methods that could describe useful patterns. As time went on, brilliant Arabic mathematicians invented al-gebra to solve more complex problems. This was used to plot the movement of the stars and planets, as well as even calculate the circumference of our very own Earth. Newton, the famed inventor of Calculus, was able to use his findings to describe the rates of change of various objects. This allowed physicists to see the world in an entirely new way. Our good friend Einstein was known to theorize things that could not be seen. We have found ourselves in a situation where our math describes phenomenon that we may never be able to see. And that is just fine.</p>
          <p>The Descartes quote above reminds one to think about the lenses we look at our environment through. Besides being the namesake of the collection, Descartes was aware that humans could not escape their pattern recognizing brains. Prior knowledge is needed to break intuition. Here is an example that still plagues us even today: We see the Earth as a sphere because of our understanding of geometry. Before the breakthroughs of Euclid and other mathematicians, the world was seen as a flat plane. People sometimes put too much trust in their own senses to describe the world around them.</p>
          <p>Humans love patterns. Our minds somehow find patterns even when there are no patterns to be found. We find beauty in patterns. Some thinkers subscribe to the thought that beauty and patterns do not exist without our brains. The color purple exists in wavelengths of light that our eyes pick up. This is what physics has found out, and would be true with or without humans around. The <i>phenomenon</i> of purple, though, only exists within our brains.</p>
          <p>The collection attempts to plays into our pattern loving brains. Each sketch is presented for the viewer to do what they do best: Find balance and beauty. The mind can not help but see implied depth and dimension in the flat works. A duet occurs between the math used to create these sketches and the brain that observes them. Without these human-like properties, none of this would be possible. The artist to credit is the collective work of all humans who had a hand is developing our descriptions of the natural world. This includes even you, the viewer whose gaze breathes life into the art presented.</p>
          <p>71 (a prime number) sketches are included in the collection. Do Enjoy.</p>
